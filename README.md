# <img src="https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2785/2785835-32.png?modified=69251a5f"> Math symbols library - Firefox Extension
Simple extension created for a request, nothing too special. Aims to make typing mathematical operations easier and faster.
Details can be found <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/math-symbols-library/">here</a>. I have no plans to further upgrade it (as for now).
